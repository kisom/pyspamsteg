hide / reveal steganographic messages in spam

usage:
    pyspamsteg -r <message file>
        reads a message from file and outputs it to stdout

    pyspamsteg -w <message file> <file>
        reads a message from file and outputs to file

    a dash ('-') may be substituted for a filename to output from stdout
    or input from stdin.
